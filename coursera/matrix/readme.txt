About the Course

When you take a digital photo with your phone or transform the image in Photoshop, when you play a video game or watch a movie with digital effects, when you do a web search or make a phone call, you are using technologies that build upon linear algebra. Linear algebra provides concepts that are crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector.

In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, and how to use them to think about problems arising in computer science. You will write small programs in the programming language Python to implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve a variety of tasks in weekly homework assignments and labs.


Course Structure

The course is structured around nine separate units (ten, if you count "Unit 0," which provides some general background you might find useful) distributed across eight weeks. Each week of class consists of several components: a series of video lectures (some containing ungraded in-video quizzes), a Homework assignment, and a Lab assignment. There are a few exceptions to this pattern—weeks that have either no Lab or, on occasion, two Homework or Lab assignments instead of the usual one. Consult the Syllabus for a detailed listing of weekly assignments and deadlines.

Typically, a Homework assignment consists of independent problems that can be solved separately; a Lab assignment consists of a series of tasks that lead you to accomplish a goal or explore an idea.

There are also two additional assignments identified as “Homework” but that are distinct from the usual Homework assignments. In the first, you complete the implementation of a Vector class. In the second, you complete the implementation of a Matrix class. You’ll want to take care with both of these assignments since they prove critical to other parts of the course.

Each week of class, including all Homework and Lab assignments, is described in more detail on the Syllabus page, where you will also find the dates and deadlines for the whole course.

New video lectures and assignments will become available each week on Monday at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern). After they have been released you can watch the lectures as many times as you want, whenever you want; they’ll remain available for the duration of the course.

You’ll have three weeks to complete each assignment. All assignments are due on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern). See the section on grading for details on how assignments are graded and penalties for late work.


Course Requirements

Requirements for this course are:

a computer with Python installed (version 3)

a browser that supports Coursera’s functionality and that supports SVG: Here you can find out some of the supported browsers.
programming ability
the ability to follow a mathematical argument

Grading

We will keep all Homework and Lab assignments for this class open for three weeks, which we believe is ample time to work through the problems, take care of technical difficulties you encounter, revise your work as you learn—and even to take the occasional vacation or break from class!

The Homework and Lab assignments are graded automatically whenever you submit your work before the deadline. Your score for each one is calculated as a percentage of the total points available for that assignment. Since the goal of these exercises is for you to learn important concepts from linear algebra—and because learning often happens when you work over a problem repeatedly—you may submit each assignment as many times as you would like before the deadline. Your highest score will be saved.

Late work: There is a grace period of exactly 3 days after the official deadline for all assignments. During this grace period you may continue to submit your work—but a penalty of 20% will automatically be deducted from your score. This means that you will receive a maximum score of 80% on any work you submit during the grace period. Once the grace period has passed, no late work will be accepted for a score.

To avoid the risk of incurring penalties due to late work, please try to submit your work early. Because of the number of students in the course, we won’t be able to offer extended deadlines or make other accommodations for individual students who miss the deadlines.


Statement of Accomplishment

If you wish to receive a Statement of Accomplishment for your work in this course, you will need to:

Receive an average score of 60% or higher on each of the Homework and Lab assignments (except on the Vector Class and Matrix Class assignments, which require a higher score; see the next point for details)
Receive an average score of 80% on the Vector Class and Matrix Class assignments. Because the work you will do for both is used later in the class, it’s especially important that you get these two assignments right. That’s why we have set such a high standard for them.
For distinction, you need to receive an average score of 85% or higher on each of the Homework and Lab assignments.


Honor Code

In order to ensure intellectual integrity and fairness, all students participating in this course agree to abide by the following code of conduct.

I will register for only one account.
My answers to homework, labs, and quizzes will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration). There will be no plagiarism in any written work I turn in, nor will I share my work—including code samples—with others in the course at any point, either before or after I have submitted it.
I will not make solutions to homework, labs, or quizzes available to anyone else. This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any official solutions provided by the course staff.
I will not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve/hurt the results of others.
Among other things, this means you shouldn’t submit work that isn’t your own, or pass off other people’s ideas as though they were yours. If you want to acknowledge someone’s work, provide a link or other citation to it. Please don’t re-use images or video in cases where you don’t have the permission of the owner or creator.

Evidence that a student has violated any terms of the Honor Code may, at the sole discretion of the instructor and the course staff, result in grade penalties or dismissal from the class.


Discussion Forum Etiquette

The Discussion Forums are a great place to meet your classmates from around the world, discuss ideas, ask for help, and learn more through the conversations and debates you engage in. You’re encouraged to be active and involved.

We do ask, however, that you follow some basic rules when participating in the forums. We expect everyone in the class to be civil and respectful at all times. It’s likely that you’ll come across ideas that you feel strongly about, and it’s equally likely that you won’t always agree with the views your classmates express. That’s fine—spirited discussion and debate can be a good way to learn—so long as you remain courteous and open-minded in your comments. You should strive to be helpful and constructive at all times, even when you disagree with your classmates.

The following behaviors are not permitted in the forums:

Personal attacks of any kind. You are welcome to disagree with someone’s ideas, but you must not put down, mock, insult, or otherwise attack the person who holds those views.
Statements that are abusive, hostile, threatening, condescending, or that belittle another person. Comments that attack another person on the basis of their appearance, race, religion, or gender have no place on the forums. Remember, students in this class are from all over the world and come from many different backgrounds; tolerance of this diversity is an important part of your involvement in the forums.
Messages containing advertising or spam.
Inappropriate posts on the forums may be edited or deleted by the course staff. If you encounter anything that you consider problematic, please let us know by using the ‘flag’ link that you’ll see next to each post or comment.

Keep your posts on topic. If you have any issues, praise, or complaints about the course, please post it in the Feedback forum.

Repeated offenses against this policy, or particularly egregious violations, may be grounds for dismissal from the course.

Before starting new threads in the forums, search for existing threads on the topic. And please try to post in the forum that is most appropriate to the topic. This will help us keep the conversations organized.
